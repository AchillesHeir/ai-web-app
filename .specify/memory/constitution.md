# ai-web-app Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Clean and Modular Code
Code should be written in a way that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. Components should be broken down into small, reusable modules.

### II. React.js Best Practices
Follow established best practices for React.js development, including component composition, state management, and hooks.

### III. Express.js Best Practices
Adhere to best practices for building APIs with Express.js, including routing, middleware, and error handling.

### IV. TypeScript Best Practices
Utilize TypeScript to its full potential by using strong typing, interfaces, and generics to create robust and maintainable code.

### V. TBD
This principle is yet to be defined.

## Development Workflow

The development workflow should follow standard Git practices, including feature branches, pull requests, and code reviews.

## Governance
This constitution is the single source of truth for project standards. All code contributions must adhere to the principles outlined in this document.
